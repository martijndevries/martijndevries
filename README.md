### Hi, I'm Martijn

ðŸ“ˆ I am a Data Scientist and Researcher from San Francisco, currently pursuing a Data Science career. <br>
âœ¨ Before my move to Data Science, I was an astrophysicist! I worked different topics, such as supermassive black holes, clusters of galaxies, and pulsars. You can find some of the projects on the page below. <br>
